# Antback

**Antback: Fast, Transparent, and Debuggable Backtesting**

A lightweight, event-loop-style backtest engine that allows a function-driven imperative style using efficient stateful helper functions and data containers.

## Key Features
- **Transparency**: Every step is visible and debuggable. No black-box logic.
- **Balances simplicity with robustness** - ideal for rapid strategy prototyping.
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Detailed reports with sorting and filtering capabilities via DataTables.
- **High Performance**: Optimized data structures for speed - very fast.
- **Easy to use with different data sources** - only needs `date` and `price` values.
-  **Avoids Lookahead Bias**: by processing data sequentially. Use wait functions to enforce delays between signals.


## Installation

A key feature is the generation of interactive HTML reports, which allow for easy inspection of trades. The lightweight [df2tables](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/df2tables) module is used for this purpose. For Excel reports, [xlreport](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/xlreport) is used.


```bash
pip install antback df2tables xlreport
```
Core functionality requires only `numpy` and `pandas` (pandas for reporting only). 

### Demo
```python
import antback as ab
ab.demo()
```
The demo feature generates random trades of several stocks at random prices and generates an interactive report. A profit is slightly more likely than a loss‚Äîit's a demo, after all.

## Quick Start

### Simple SMA Crossover Strategy

```python
import numpy as np
import antback as ab

import yfinance as yf
symbol = "QQQ"
data = yf.Ticker(symbol).history(period='10y')

port = ab.Portfolio(10_000, single=True)
fast, slow  = 10, 30

prices = ab.RollingList(maxlen=slow)
cross = ab.new_cross_func()

for date, price in data["Close"].items():
    prices.append(price)
    price_history = prices.values()
    signal = "update"  # Reset signal - just update portfolio position 
    
    if len(price_history) >= slow:
        fast_ma, slow_ma = np.mean(price_history[-fast:]), np.mean(price_history[-slow:])
        direction = cross(fast_ma, slow_ma)  # active crosses  passive
        if direction == "up":
            signal = "buy"
        elif direction == "down":
            signal = "sell"
    port.process(signal, symbol, date, price)

port.basic_report(show=True)

descr = f"Simple SMA Crossover on {symbol}"
port.full_report("html", outfile=f"{descr}_report.html", title=descr)
```

### Generate excel report
```
port.full_report('excel', outfile=f'{descr}_report.xlsx', title=descr)
```
See detailed [excel report](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/portfolio-report.xlsx) generated with above example.

> **Note**: In fact, the average lengths in this case are slightly optimized; see: [examples/07_optimization.py](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/07_optimization.py). The results may be even better if trailing ATR stop is used ([examples/04_atr_stop.py](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/04_atr_stop.py)) for the sell signal instead of the averages.

## Core Components
### Portfolio Class

The main trading engine that handles position management, trade execution, and performance tracking:

```python
port = ab.Portfolio(
    cash=10_000,              # Starting capital (minimum 10,000)
    single=True,              # Single asset mode
    warn=False,               # Show warnings
    allow_fractional=False,   # Allow fractional shares
    fees=0.0015              # Trading fees (0.15%)
)
```

**Trading Patterns:**
- **Simple strategies**: Use ```port.process()```
```python
if direction == "up":
    signal = 'buy'
elif direction == "down":
    signal = 'sell'
port.process(signal, symbol, date, price)
```
- **Complex strategies**: Use `port.buy()`, `port.sell()`, `port.update()` 
```python
if direction == "up":
    port.buy(symbol, date, price)
elif direction == "down":
    port.sell(symbol, date, price)
port.update(symbol, date, price)
  ```
See [06_simple_2_assets_rotation.py](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/06_simple_2_assets_rotation.py).

### Important Notes
- **No re-buying or re-selling**: Duplicate signals are ignored (set `warn=True` to see warnings)
- **Multi-position support** - Currently supported with manual trade sizing via `fixed_val` parameter. (set single=False, [example](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/06_faber_assets_rotation.py) ). 
- **Intraday support**: Available but not extensively tested
- **Long-only**: Currently, only long positions are possible.


## Useful functions
### Wait Functions - Preventing Lookahead Bias

Example use of a wait function.

```python
sell_timer = ab.new_wait_n_bars(4) # wait 4 bars, then sell

for date, price in data:
    signal = None
    ready_to_sell = sell_timer(bar=date)
    if ready_to_sell:
        signal = 'sell'
    if buy_conditon:
        signal = 'buy'
        sell_timer(start=True)
    port.process(signal, symbol, date, price)
```
See examples [05_easter_effect_test.py](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/05_easter_effect_test.py).

There is also a per-ticker wait version (new_multi_ticker_wait) that creates separate functions for each symbol:
[wait demo](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/12_wait_example.py)

### Cross Function

```new_cross_func()``` returns a stateful crossover detector function that tracks when one time series crosses another.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** In most cases, the **active** series is a *shorter time frame* indicator compared to the **passive** series. This means it reacts faster to changes, making crossovers more responsive.

The returned function compares an **active** and **passive** series value at each call and returns:
- **`up`** when the **active** value moves from below to above the **passive** value
- **`down`** when the **active** value moves from above to below the **passive** value
- `None` if there's no crossover or insufficient data



### Optimized Data Structures

#### RollingArray
Fast numpy-based rolling window  (Uses manual slice assignment ([:] = [...])	In-place operation; avoids temporary memory allocations. 
can be 2 to 10 times faster than np.roll.
```python
prices = ab.RollingArray(window_size=50)
prices.append(new_price)
price_history = prices.values()
```

#### RollingList  
Efficient deque-based storage for objects:
```python
prices = ab.RollingList(maxlen=30)
prices.append(price_data)
recent_prices = prices.values()
```
#### Multi-ticker strategies

For more advanced multi-ticker strategies or those using machine learning, it's often necessary to track more than a few dozen rolling features. The ```NamedRollingArrays``` and ```PerTickerNamedRollingArrays``` classes are available for this purpose ([rolling demo](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/13_rolling_demo.py)).

## More Examples & Use Cases
Explore the [examples](examples/) to see Antback in action‚Äîfrom basic strategies to  multi-asset rotations.

### Mebane Faber‚ÄìStyle Asset Rotation (10-Month SMA)

This example implements a variation of the tactical asset allocation strategy popularized by **Mebane Faber** in *The Ivy Portfolio*.  
It compares a **3-month SMA** with a **10-month SMA** for multiple assets and rotates into assets whose short-term trend is above the long-term trend, rebalancing at **month-end only**.

**Key points in this implementation:**
- **No resampling to monthly closes**: The 10-month SMA is calculated using **daily data**, but trading decisions are only made on **month-end dates** obtained from  
  `antback.get_monthly_points()`. This avoids distortions caused by monthly bar aggregation.
- **Equal-weight allocation** to selected assets.
- **Multi-asset support** (e.g., SPY, GLD, TLT).
- Uses `ab.NamedRollingLists` to efficiently maintain rolling daily prices for SMA calculation.

üí°*Puzzle for the reader*: Try adding Bitcoin to the mix by including `'BTC-USD'` in the ticker list‚Ä¶ **see what happens**.

[06_faber_assets_rotation.py](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/blob/main/examples/06_faber_assets_rotation.py).  


### Machine Learning Trading Strategy Example

This example demonstrates how to implement a machine learning-based trading strategy using Antback with technical features and scikit-learn classifiers. Uses **NamedRollingLists** maintains multiple synchronized rolling windows optimized for high-frequency feature updates.

#### Feature Engineering
- Market timing features (day of month, weekday)
- Price action metrics (gaps, drawdowns)
- Technical indicators (RSI, ROC)
- Candle patterns and characteristics

Rolling Window Calculations: feature calculations, such as get_indicator_value_and_score, use data only from the past within a defined rolling window. 

#### Use of Transformers:
Use fit_transform on the training data and only transform on the test data. This ensures that information from the test set (like its data distribution for binning or categories for encoding) does not "leak" into the transformation process.
- Training: ```discretizer.fit_transform(...)```
- Testing: ```discretizer.transform(...)```

#### Training Process
- Calculates forward returns as targets
- Encodes categorical features
- Discretizes numerical features
- Trains the classifier
#### To-do
Implement Walk-Forward Optimization: Instead of a single train/test split, use a walk-forward approach.

### Performance & Technical Indicators

Antback does not include its own indicators (except for a useful ATR stop line), but you can use any technical analysis (TA) library. Antback is most suitable with event-driven technical indicators. For optimal performance, [talipp](https://github.com/nardew/talipp) indicators, which is designed for streaming data may be used:

```python
from talipp.indicators import SMA

fast_sma, slow_sma = SMA(period=10), SMA(period=30)

for date, price in data.items():
    fast_sma.add(price)
    slow_sma.add(price)
    
    if fast_sma[-1] and slow_sma[-1]:  # Check if indicators have valid data
        signal = determine_signal(fast_sma[-1], slow_sma[-1])
```
### Performance

Although Antback was not specifically designed for speed, it is **surprisingly fast**. Run the benchmark included with the examples (30-year SPY moving average crossover).
